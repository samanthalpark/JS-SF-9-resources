/**
 * Arrays & Iteration
 * Most of your answers should be stored in variables called q1, q2 etc..

 * See Question 0, which is already completed, for an example.

/*
 * Question 0
 * Create a variable that stores the string "GA JSD Class 3 lab".
*/

// This question is already completed for you as an example:
let q0 = 'GA JSD Class 3 lab';
console.log('Question 0: ' + q0);

/**
 * Question 1
 * Create a variable called numbers containing an array of numbers using 1, 2, 3, 
 * and 4 as values.
 * Use a map function to increase each value by 1, storing the result
 * in a new array with the name q1. The end result should be a second array of
 * numbers with the values 2, 3, 4, and 5.

/**
 * Question 2
 * Using the numbers array from Question 1, find the average of the numbers in
 * the array (average = sum of all numbers/number of numbers). Store the average
 * in a variable named q2.
 */

/**
 * BONUS:
 * Question 3
 * Create an variable called q3 containing an array of numbers using 1, 2, 3, 
 * and 4 as values.
 * Use a forEach function to increase each value by 1, updating the values
 * in the original array. This should result in the original array you created
 * storing the values 2, 3, 4, and 5.
 * (Hint: Read about the index parameter for the forEach method:
